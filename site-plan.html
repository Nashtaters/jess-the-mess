      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
          My company makes crafts by hand and by order.  Is there something that you want made, or need more decorations for your home?<br>
          That is what our website is all about.  We aim to have it clear and have contact info for the orders and price range very easy to see.<br>
          There won’t be any need for a lot of info, or useless jargon, just the information that is most important to the customers.
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The audience is young women ages 18-30 years old.  If there is any young woman that is interested in making crafts or have cute<br>
        decorations for their home, then this is the place to look. For women that want to have handmade crafts, this is the place for them.<br>
        All of our crafts are handmade and unique to each order<br>
        ***orders of 10 or more must call ahead***

      <h3>Orders Gallery</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Browsing</b><br>
        There can be a wide variety of questions that will be answered just by exploring this<br>
        site.  If you are wondering what can be ordered, how to order, or need a selection to<br>
        choose from, look and ask no further.  We got that covered for you!  If you are worried<br>
        about the cost and the price of everything, that is totally answered as well.  We will give<br>
        you a price estimate before you are sure of what you want.  We will also give you all of the<br>
        color options that we have and if you just want us to make you something with a simple<br>
        description, we will be more than happy to do that as well.<br>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>What to Order</b><br>
        These projects are made by hand by an individual. This means that individualized orders can<br>
        be made. If someone wants a project done a little differently than the ones pictured this can be<br>
        accommodated because the items are made after they are ordered and so the changes can be<br>
        done.  There will be more options available to our customers than any other crafting site and<br>
        we try to build a better relationship with our customers.  They are more than just a number<br>
        and a price tag.  They are our friends and people that share our love of creativity and<br>
        imagination.  We have the tools and ability to make products that are professional and<br>
        will last for years to come unlike products you may buy elsewhere, such as big brand<br>
        companies.  Each item is made carefully and with love.  We treat each craft as if it will<br>
        be presented in our own home and take great care to make it the best it can be.  Our<br>
        products are unique and cannot be found elsewhere.  On the second page of our site<br>
        we have a great selection of pictures of things that we are able to craft for you!<br>
        These are not all of what we can craft, but just some examples that could help get more<br>
        ideas of what you might want.<br>

        <b>How to Order</b><br>
        The ways to order through this site are guaranteed to be very easy and simple to use.  We are aiming to<br>
        fulfil peoples dreams of stickers, vinyl cutouts, to woodworking and customized décor.  We<br>
        will have a simple contact us page that has our customers enter their name, email and a brief<br>
        (or lengthy) description of they want.  Our goal is to let these customers leave feeling very<br>
        satisfied and confident that their ideas and imaginations will come to life before their eyes<br>
        and we want to promote imagination and creativity to everyone.  We want to do our best to bring<br>
        these things to life!<br>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Information</b><br>
        It is important for us to give the customer all of the information that they want.  For example,<br>
        we want to be upfront of prices and how long each craft or order may take.  We also want<br>
        to have the selection of certain options that we have available.  We also want to make sure<br>
        that everyone is aware that all of the crafts are made by hand and all are unique and not<br>
        manufactured in a factory.  We also want to inform how long shipping may take or if<br>
        pickup is an available option.  That would be discussed after an order has been made.<br>
